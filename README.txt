This is a small remake of the classic game pong I've made for fun. I added the possibility of increase the speed of the ball by moving the paddle to the right or to the left. I've made an AI to play against users. AI difficult level can't be changed. It's quite difficult to defeat at least for me, maybe you defeat it easily. Though I think that's unlikely. I hope you enjoy playing against the artificial intelligence I made it was very difficult to make it because it was the first time I made something like that. If you want how I made it, you may go to the link I wrote before and watch the streaming, it's a bit long though if you like watching how a video game. I dislike watching people coding because I think it's pretty bored though I love coding. I don't know how that may be possible ;) The video is a bit long though I've watched longer videos than this one. I won't kill you if you don't watch the video, I'm just saying that I recorded how I made it. Okay, I'll stop of saying strange things because it seems like I'm crazy or something like that ^____^
